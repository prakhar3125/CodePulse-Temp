## ✨ Key Features

This application is packed with features to provide a comprehensive and personalized study experience.

#### 🧠 Plan Generation & Customization
* **Personalized Study Plan:** Generates a unique study plan based on your self-assessed skill level (Beginner, Intermediate, Pro), the duration you want to study for, and the topics you want to focus on.
* **🎯 Topic Selection:** Choose from a wide range of essential topics like Arrays, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, and more. Or leave it blank for a well-rounded, comprehensive curriculum.
* **🗓️ Flexible Duration:** Select a preset duration (e.g., 2 Weeks, 1 Month) or input a custom number of days for your study plan.
* **➕ Add Custom Problems:** Easily add your own problems to the schedule, complete with a name, difficulty, topic, and a link to the problem statement.

#### 📊 Productivity & Tracking
* **Interactive Dashboard:** Visualize your progress at a glance. The dashboard features stats on total problems, completed tasks, overall completion percentage, and a progress bar.
* **🔔 Spaced Repetition:** When you complete a problem, the app automatically schedules it for review at increasing intervals to reinforce learning. The dashboard shows how many problems are due for review.
* **📋 Daily Task Manager:** View your problems organized by day. Each day is marked as 'Past', 'Today', or 'Future' with clear visual cues.
* **✅ Progress Tracking:** Mark problems as complete with a single click. The UI updates instantly, striking through the problem name and updating your daily and overall progress.

#### 📝 Enhanced Note-Taking
* **Rich Text Notes:** For every problem, you can add, view, and edit detailed notes with an editor designed for technical documentation.
* **💻 Built-in Code Blocks:** Directly embed code snippets into your notes with syntax highlighting. A toolbar allows you to insert code blocks for various languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, C++).
* **🚀 Note Templates:** Speed up your note-taking with pre-defined templates for `Approach`, `Complexity Analysis`, and `Edge Cases`.
* **🔗 External Links:** Each problem card includes a direct link to its LeetCode page or a custom URL for quick access.

#### 🎨 User Experience
* **🌗 Dark & Light Mode:** Toggle between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Your preference is saved in your browser for a consistent experience.
* **📱 Fully Responsive Design:** The interface is optimized for all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.
* **👤 User Authentication:** A simple and clean authentication page to manage user sessions, with the header displaying the logged-in user's profile.
* **💡 Intuitive UI:** Built with modern design principles and helpful icons from `lucide-react` to make navigation feel natural.
* **🔒 Guided Setup:** A user-friendly modal prevents navigation to the dashboard or tasks before a study plan is generated, guiding the user through the setup process.
